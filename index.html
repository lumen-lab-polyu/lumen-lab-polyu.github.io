    NOTE(daniel): if we use the `home` layout, it will automatically write blog
    posts at the end. For now let's not do this but we might reconsider if we
    have stuff to write about.

<style>
  /* Adjust the page width just for this page alone. */
  .container-md {
    max-width: 1500px; /* Set your desired maximum width */
    margin-left: auto;

  /* Add any other custom styles for the page */
  body {
    margin: 0; /* Set margin to 0 for the entire body */

The Lumen Lab at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) investigates fundamental research problems to enable efficient utilizations of AI techniques. 
    In particular, we focus on learning and modeling with limited resources in terms of data, computing capability, as well as exploring their derivative applications on wide spectrums. 
    Some specific topics include zero and few-shot learning, collaborative and federated learning, representation learning, model compression, and lightweight solutions of large foundation models. 
    <a href="https://jingcaiguo.github.io/">Prof. Jingcai Guo</a> directs the Lumen Lab.

<p>
We are actively recruiting self-motivated <b>PhD Students</b>, <b>Postdoctoral Researchers</b>, and <b>Research Assistants</b> to work and have fun together on multiple research projects. <b>Visiting Students/Researchers</b> (onsite/remote) are also welcome!. If you are interested in joining the lab, please see the
<b><a href="https://lumen-lab-polyu.github.io/join_us">Join Us</a></b> page.

Why the name Lumen? ^_^ It's a reference to
<a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/">the cluster management and job scheduling system</a>
used for Linux clusters. It is very helpful for many research labs!
