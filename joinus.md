Thank you for your interest in our research! See below for how you can get
involved. 
<!--This information is last updated **March 2025**.-->

If you have additional questions after reading the below and want to get involved, feel free to email me.
My contact information is [available on my website](https://jingcaiguo.github.io/).
I will try to respond to emails that are tailored to our lab. For example, they might explain why our lab is a good fit between us. 

## PhD Students

PolyU is committed to fostering academic excellence. A range of scholarships is designed to support the research studies, empowering students to excel in their PhD journey at our university.

- **RGC Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS)**: HKPFS aims to support the best and brightest students in the world with a prestigious fellowship to pursue their PhD studies. The HKPFS package includes 1) Annual Stipend: HK$337,200, 2) Annual Conference Grant: HK$14,000, and 3) Cash Award: HK$40,000 for the first year, and HK$20,000 per year from the second year to the end of the normal study period.
- **PolyU Presidential PhD Fellowship Scheme (PPPFS)**: PPPFS is a prestigious scheme designed for top candidates from around the world with exceptional academic/research achievements to pursue their PhD studies. The PPPFS package includes 1) Annual Stipend: HK$333,480, 2) Conference Grant: HK$25,000, and 3) Cash Award: HK$40,000 for the first year, and HK$20,000 per year from the second year to the end of the normal study period.

I am especially interested in working with students with the following
experience, skills, or criteria:

- who have built, fixed, and engineered robotics hardware.
- who have implemented robotics or physics simulators.
- who have significant experience in deep learning, imitation/reinforcement
  learning, and vision-language (foundation) models.
- who have applied robotics to fields such as agriculture and health care.
- who come from underrepresented, non-traditional, and/or low-income
  backgrounds, but who have reasonably "maxed out" their available resources to
  learn about robotics and machine learning.

I think this is a great time to be working in robotics. 
We also have an excellent [robotics group at USC][3].

PhD students will receive funding. The normal requirement is to TA for two
semesters. Beyond those two semesters, I will do my best to support you with as
much research funding as I can.

If you are a PhD student already at USC and interested in collaborating with me,
feel free to email me to schedule a time to chat. To reduce back-and-forth
emails, please clearly indicate *what* you would like to discuss and a *range*
of available times.

## Masters and Undergraduate Students at USC

**Please fill out [the following application][1]**. We actively monitor this form, 
but **it can help to send me a brief email reminder to check the form**. Do *not*
attach any documents to this email, since you can upload them in the form. We
will reach out if we decide to interview you.

## Postdocs

I am not actively searching for postdocs and I also do not have funding for one. 
However, if you feel like there's a
good match and that there might be opportunities to get funding, I am happy to
consider options. Please email me and include at least this information: (i) a
brief summary of two project ideas we could work on, (ii) contact information 
for at least two references, and (iii) your one or two strongest papers. 

## External Visitors not at USC

I may eventually be able to work with external visitors who are not currently
at USC, but I expect this to be a very rare circumstance.
To apply, *email me by pitching me a project idea (0.5 to 1.0 pages)*.
I do not have any funding for such positions at the moment.


## Advising Statement

Here is my brief perspective on advising.

- I want to work on high-impact problems in robotics, and especially robotic
  manipulation. Whenever possible, projects and/or papers should show *many*
  real world examples of a robot adjusting its environment (including successes
  *and* failures). I am less interested in projects which eke out small
  improvements on benchmarks.
- For presenting research, our target conferences are ICRA, IROS, RSS, and
  CoRL, though we will consider other venues as appropriate (such as machine
  learning conferences).
- Unless we are legally forbidden from doing so, all papers/projects will have
  code, data, and other supplementary material available to help with
  reproducing results.
- I am a very hands-on advisor who actively works closely with all lab members.
  I am available for regular or impromptu in-person meetings, and am available
  on the lab's Slack for additional communication.
- I want my students to be successful and will support academic, industry, or
  other career paths. I will regularly discuss with students about how to
  facilitate their career growth. I encourage PhD students to have 1-3
  internships at top industry labs.
- I will follow a code of conduct which includes an anti-harassment policy.
  I share the policy with lab members and ask that they follow it as well. As
  per the policy, if you meet with me, you can expect me to conduct myself
  professionally in our interactions both within the lab and outside of it.
- Students should feel welcomed to challenge me. If a lab policy is not working,
  or if my research suggestion does not make sense, say so.

If this all sounds good, please apply to work with me!
